The fibonacci benchmark is a recursive function which tests the performance of the stack mainly
Originally fibonacci 30 was used however this ran for over 5 minutes without completing
1000 iterations of the fibonacci function with argument 20 are printed during this test
fibonacci(20): 
	Lua: 767 milliseconds average
	SDIM:
The hello world benchmark tests the performance of the print statement
Mainly focusing on maximum throughput
This test prints hello world 10,000 times
hello world:
	Lua: 150 milliseconds average
	SDIM:
The is_prime benchmark tests the general performance of the language

is_prime:
	Lua: 55 milliseconds average
